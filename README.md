# multiRenderShader
A processing sketch that renders 1 dimentional Cellular automata, Conway's Life and Fractals (fractals are rendered using a shader)
The program can record its output by pressing 'R' to an mp4 file. This requires the installation of the optional ffmpeg movie export library, obtainable using the processing package manager.
Note that you should stop recording by pressing 'R' again and press 'Q' to exit the program in order to finalize the mp4 movie.
When the program starts, it autozooms slowly. You can adjust the zoom factor in the code. You can switch between the 3 different modes
CA1D, LIFE and MANDEL by pressing the keys '1', '2' and '3'.
You can see an example of this program in this youtube video:
